# FN group manager
#### group manager power by Python
##### version `1.1` 
##### using python-telegram-bot module
##### it's and inchoate version of this.i will work on so much :)


here is my roadmap.(this list will be longer by time)
- [x] set comamnd and text for group replies, like smart-question
- [x] general options like start | help | coder 
- [ ] lock and unlock links
- [ ] lock and unluck stickers
- [ ] lock and unlock forwards
- [ ] lock messages by hour like 8 hourse
- [x] remove user
- [x] delete last message by count for example last 100 message
- [x] command /me gives data about guy who has been replied for 
- [x] report option, forwards it to admin

### to fix
* anti-link setter works but it doesnt remove links also same for the anti-sticker
* update /help command
