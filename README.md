# FN group manager
#### group manager power by Python
##### version `1.2` 
##### using python-telegram-bot module
##### it's and inchoate version of this. i will work on so much :)


here is my roadmap.(this list will be longer by time)
- [x] set comamnd and text for group replies, like smart-question
- [x] general options like start | help | coder 
- [x] lock and unlock links
- [x] lock and unluck stickers
- [x] lock and unlock forwards
- [ ] lock messages by hour like 8 hourse
- [x] remove user
- [x] delete last message by count for example last 100 message
- [x] command /me gives data about guy who has been replied for 
- [x] report option, forwards it to admin
- [x] function to get groups settings details
- [ ] create db for TODO number 1 

### to fix
* anti-link setter works but it doesnt remove links also same for the anti-sticker
* update /help command
